# Configuration

Before using HelloHost there are several options that can be configured. You can find these options by hovering over your account and selecting the `Settings` link.

## General

Here you can configure your brand colors, logo's and the languages that will be available to you and your users. 

## Accounts

Security and user access settings to allow users to create their own account.

## Mail

Configure an SMTP email account to send personalized email. If you do not configure this section all email will be sent from `{brandname}@hellohost.nl` and might not be delivered correctly. You will need SMTP credentials in most cases. Certain providers require their own way of handling logins.
